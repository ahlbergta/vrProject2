# CS 4331-002 - Virtual Reality Project 2

## Project Description

Our purpose is to give the user a basic idea on how the climate can change by the rise of temperature and carbon dioxide levels. In order to simulate this we allow the user to grab coal and input it into a fire place that will increase carbon dioxide and temperature level based on the amount of coal inputted. Once the user adds coal they can look outside and see how water levels rise and the glaciers in the background melt.

## Work Distribution

* Travis Ahlberg: Added the map with lights that represent the states/cities that are affected by climate change

* Eddie Garcia: The ability for the user to pick up coal and drop into fire place

* Emre Unal: Created the effects of glacier melting and water levels rising

* Justin Wright: Researched temperature and carbon dioxide levels with providing graphs of projected level rise over years to come
