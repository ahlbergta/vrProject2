## Project Description

Our purpose is to give the user a basic idea on how the climate can change by the rise of temperature and carbon dioxide levels. In order to simulate this we allow the user to grab coal and input it into a fire place that will increase carbon dioxide and temperature level based on the amount of coal inputted. Once the user adds coal they can look outside and see how water levels rise and the glaciers in the background melt.

## Work Distribution

* Travis Ahlberg: Added the map with lights that represents the states/cities that are affected by climate change

* Eddie Garcia: The ability for the user to pick up coal and drop into fire place

* Emre Unal: Created the effects of glacier melting and water levels rising

* Justin Wright: Researched temperature and carbon dioxide levels with providing graphs of projected level rise over years to come


## Biggest Issues 

* Trying to get the Oculus Rift work for our project.
* Merging code to finish project.
* Pushing lots of files to Github.

## Fire Place 

In the image provided below Eddie created the ability for the user to grab coal that is shown in front of the fire place and place it in the fire. The user is given a maximum of five coal pieces and each will affect the climate based on how much inputted.

## Data

This is our data on temperature, carbon, and water levels rising by the year 2100. Justin added graphs to show how everything will rise for years to come. He researched and cited the websites below the image as reference.

## Environment

Emre created the visual effect that the user can look out the window once they add a coal to the fire place. After a certain amount of coal, the water levels will rise and the glaciers will get smaller. In the image provided below this is an example of just two coal pieces add. In the image the trees are already below water level since the temperature has risen.

## Areas affected

Travis created a map view of the United States and once a piece of coal is adding a flashing red light will show which cities/ states are affected. The initial stage of the map starts off with none of the lights blinking red. However, in this image we show how many light are flashing by adding two coal pieces.
